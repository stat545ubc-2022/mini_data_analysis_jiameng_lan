# mini_data_analysis_jiameng_lan
This repository is for STAT545A course. It contains two mini data analysis assignments. 
Both the assignments use the flow_sample data in datateachr. The assignments are investigating some research questions related to the flow data over the months or years.
Please load tidyverse and datateachr to engage with the assignments.
# This repository contains milestone1 assignment files and a bit structural modification based on milestone2 requirement. But it kept showing "no branch" on local repository, the milestone2 assignment and all milestone1 files have been put in the new repository https://github.com/stat545ubc-2022/mini_data_analysis2_jiameng_lan.git.
